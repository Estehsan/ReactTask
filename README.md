# Movie App 
This is a web application that allows users to search for TV series using the TV maze API. The search results are displayed in a list and users can view more information about each TV series in another view.


## Installation: 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
### `git clone git@github.com:Estehsan/ReactTask.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
### `cd ReactTask`

3. Run npm install to install all dependencies.
### `npm install` OR `yarn install`

4. Run npm start to start the development server.
### `npm start`

5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
### `http://localhost:3000`


## What I would have done if I had more time? 

1. Implement responsive design to make the application more mobile-friendly and accessible on smaller screens.
2. Add a feature to allow users to sort the search results by various criteria, such as alphabetically, by rating, or by popularity.
3. Implement a feature to allow users to filter the search results by language or country of origin.
4. Add a feature to allow users to watch trailers or clips from the TV series.
5. Implement an autocomplete feature to suggest TV series names as the user types in the search bar.
